Project Description

This repository contains Ansible playbooks designed to automate the deployment of a Kubernetes cluster using Kubeadm on Linux servers (specifically Ubuntu Server). The main objective of this project is to simplify and standardize the initial setup process of a Kubeadm cluster, from node preparation to the installation of core Kubernetes components. The playbooks handle the installation of necessary dependencies, configure operating system parameters, initialize the Kubeadm control plane, and join the worker nodes to the cluster. Configuration of Calico as the Container Network Interface (CNI) is also included.
